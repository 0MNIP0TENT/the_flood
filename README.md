# The goal of this project is to make writting bots for sc2 in python easier.

## This wrapper around **python-sc2** focuses on the units. Once you tell it to create a unit the necessary buildings will be created. most upgrades work as well.

## Getting python starcraft 2 
pip sc2 

## In the main.py file there are 6 overridable methods for controlling base expansion, upgrades, training units, and attacking. The base is automatically defended with a methode I wrote called kill_invaders.

## example.py shows how you should use the main.py file yourself and is a reference.

## To get started you should run the main.py file then add functionality to it.

Interesting abilities may be added in the future.
