# This project is to make writting bots for the zerg faction in starcraft2 easier.

## This wrapper around **python-sc2** is focuses on the units. Once you tell it to create a unit the necessary buildings will be created. most upgrades work as well.

You should only have to add your own code to the **assault**, **training**, and **upgrade**. The functions were you add your code are called, **seek_and_destroy**, **research_upgrades**, and **train_units**. The main file controls the expansion of bases in the **spread** function if you want to change that. More features for unit abilities will eventually be added.
